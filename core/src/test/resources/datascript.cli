  town of Meung, in which the author of ROMANCE OF THE ROSE was born, appeared to
	be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made
	a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying
	toward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open doors,
	hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat uncertain
	courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the
	hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing
	every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of curiosity.';

  some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There were
	nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who made
	war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against the
	king. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or open
	wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and scoundrels,
	who made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up arms readily
	against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against nobles or
	Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against cardinal or
	Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said first Monday
	of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and seeing neither
	the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de Richelieu,
	rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived there, the
	cause of the hubbub was apparent to all';

	any expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little service. Our
	best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able
	to obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, swordsmanship in all its

	comradeship which I might have established with one of my
	fellow-reporters upon the Gazette,--perfectly frank, perfectly kindly,

	frank and at her ease with me.  It is no compliment to a man.  Where
	the real sex feeling begins, timidity and distrust are its companions,
	heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in
	hand.  The bent head, the averted eye, the faltering voice, the wincing
	figure--these, and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply, are the
	true signals of passion.  Even in my short life I had learned as much
	as that--or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct.';

	international crisis or a split in the Cabinet.  Sometimes we saw him
	passing in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum, with his eyes staring
	vaguely and his mind hovering over the Balkans or the Persian Gulf.  He
	was above and beyond us.  But McArdle was his first lieutenant, and it

	pushed his spectacles far up on his bald forehead.';
