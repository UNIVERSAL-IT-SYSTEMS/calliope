Calliope
========
Calliope is a library providing an interface to consume data from Cassandra to spark and store RDDs from Spark to Cassandra.

In Greek mythology, Calliope (/kəˈlaɪ.əpiː/ kə-ly-ə-pee; Ancient Greek: Καλλιόπη Kalliopē "beautiful-voiced") was the muse of epic poetry,daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne, and is believed to be Homer's muse, the inspiration for the Odyssey and the Iliad.

We hope Calliope will also be the muse for your epic data poetry!
